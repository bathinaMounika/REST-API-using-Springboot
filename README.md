## Points to remember

- Resources: /flowers/,  /countries/, /users, /students
- Resources are always plural nouns
- Actions are always described by the HTTP methods which are verbs. Example: PUT, GET, POST, DELETE ...
- Any method can be used to implement any action, but following conventions is a preofessional coder hobby
